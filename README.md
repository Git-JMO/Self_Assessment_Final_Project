# Self_Assessment_Final_Project
## Purpose of assignment:
   * The purpose of this assignment was to provide a self-assessment, team-assessment, and a brief summary of my data bootcamp final project 

## Self-Assessment:
   * Overall, I believe I was a vital asset to my team's success in this final project. Moreover, I was the one who initially pitched the concept for our project and immediately volunteered to take the lead on data visualization and creating the dashboard. In the beginning, I coordinated a zoom meeting and volunteered to help visually map out the way our ETL process will look using everyone's reccomendations/feedback. Using my strengths in Tableau data cleaning, dashboard and story creation, I was also able to create a visually appealing "story" that entailed multiple dashboards and even incorporated dynamic filter functions. I also created my Dashboard branch on Github and made sure to push any relevant items to that branch. 
   * When it came to subjects that others had taken the lead on (i.e. SQL Database Creation, Machine Learning analysis), I made sure to be a good team player and give feedback whenever possible. I made time to participate in multiple team discussions and volunteered to assist wherever possible. I ensured to maintain open communication with my team, even during times I knew would be difficult for me. 
   * There were many challenges I had to overcome in order to complete my part of the project. The greatest personal challenge I had was my wife going into labor two weeks early during the initial phases of the final project. However, I am glad I frontloaded all my work in the beginning so I would not have to scramble as much during the final phases of the project. Once home from the hospital, I still made sure to dedicate my time to my team and made sure we were successful.
